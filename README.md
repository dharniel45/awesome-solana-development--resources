This is a curated list of amazing resources to kickstart your Solana development Journey

##Overview

The Solana Blockchain is one of the most talked-about technologies in the world right now. The demand for blockchain platform apps is also growing by the day, and as a result, blockchain solutions like Solana are growing at an amazing rate.

The Solana team has created a formidable technological approach to DeFi and NFTs, attracting a large number of programmers to incorporate Solana into their projects. Solana is known for its efficient design, fast transaction speeds, and less crowded developer environment with thousands of projects spanning DeFi, NFTs, Web3, and more.

## Tools

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) ~ The vast majority of Solana programs are written in Rust. Rust is an open-source, high-performance, statically typed, and memory-efficient programming language. It enables developers to "write faster and more reliable software" while easily controlling low-level details such as memory.
- [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/) ~ Anchor is a framework for developing secure Solana applications. It abstracts away from the low level account construction, the packing and unpacking, and the altering of the Solana program's interfaces.
- [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) ~ Arweave is a decentralized, cryptographically validated permanent archive based on a cryptocurrency that seeks to deliver practical data permanence for the first time. Arweave eliminates the requirement for Solana validators to run full nodes by giving instant access to past Solana data. I am a fan of Arweave as I store my data permanently in total privacy.
- [Metaplex](https://docs.metaplex.com/?utm_source=solana.com) ~ Metaplex is a Solana-powered protocol that enables the creation and minting of non-fungible tokens, as well as auctions and the visualisation of NFTs.
- [Alchemy Supernode](https://www.alchemy.com/supernode) ~ Alchemy's Supernode provides a fully developed suite of APIs for interacting with the blockchain and getting critical blockchain data.
- [Phantom](https://phantom.app/) ~ Phantom is a wallet to store, buy, send, manage digital assets, and access decentralized applications on the Solana blockchain.
